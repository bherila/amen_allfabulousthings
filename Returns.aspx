        <b>Returns due to Damaged Product</b><br />
        Products are brand new and in perfect condition when they are professionally hand
        packed. However, we do ship fragile items which may break from time to time. If
        your item is damaged upon receipt, you should file a claim for reimbursement with
        the shipping agent. Your purchase from Absolutely Fabulous Things AMEN, LLC. is
        automatically shipped with full insurance protection. We will not directly accept
        broken or damaged merchandise for return.
    </p>

        <b>Wrong Item Received</b><br />
        If you receive the wrong item, you may be eligible for a replacement. In this case,
        you should refuse the package as soon as it is delivered and have it returned to
        sender. Otherwise, you will be responsible for the return shipping cost. If the
        item is damaged, do not return it to us. Instead, file an insurance claim with the
        shipping agent. We will not accept returns or exchanges for broken items. If you
        return an item in this way by refusing it, you should immediately contact us to
        let us know what happened and what is wrong. If the item is not incorrect, you will
        be responsible for shipping fees to return the item to you. Refunds are not offered.

        <b>Unsatisfied</b><br />
        Since we opened our doors in 2001, we have never had a dissatisfied customer. You should
        carefully make your selections before purchasing, because many items on this site
        are custom made for you. Therefore, we do not accept returns unless the wrong item
        has been received. Also please note that special requests cannot always be honored.
        If customization is a significant issue, you may wish to call us instead, at
        (908) 204-8989.
