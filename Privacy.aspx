        <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></div>
    <div style="font-size: 10px;; width: 500px">
        User privacy is of utmost concern to us, and as such, we have established the following
        policies governing your usage of this site: We explicitly identify when we need
        information from you that may be deemed "personal." For more enhanced and personalized
        services you may elect to tell us things that you want us to remember for you. We
        hope that, like many of our customers, you will want to provide information about
        yourself, as that information makes our Web site more valuable to you.<br />
        <br />
        We may, from time to time, ask demographic or personal preference questions. You
        are never required to answer these questions. This data may be used for analyzing
        overall site demographics, user preferences and tastes, and similar "getting to
        know our customers" purposes. We may disclose this data to third parties (such as
        summary reports for our advertisers), but never with user data or identification
        assigned to the information provided.<br />
        <br />
        The choice of how much personal information you choose to disclose to us is left
        completely up to you. However you choose to interact with our services and site,
        you have our guarantee of privacy: we will never willfully disclose individually
        identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving
        that users express permission.<br />
        <br />
        We catalog traffic patterns throughout the site, including identifying browser and
        system data. We gather this data to optimize site conditions for our users. This
        data, with no personal information, may also be provided to advertisers and potential
        advertisers so they may better evaluate their advertising options.<br />
        <br />
        Security: We ensure the confidentiality and security of information by taking all
        reasonable and prudent steps necessary to protect your personal information. While
        no security measure is foolproof, we believe that we have implemented a system that
        is as safe as today's technology permits. Since we realize the importance of protecting
        your privacy, we will continue to evaluate new technologies and make improvements
        as these technologies become feasible.<br />
        <br />
        If at any time you feel that we have not adhered to this policy, please contact
        us and we will make all reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the
        issue.<br />
