        <b>Local Pickup</b><br />
        Customers in the Bernardsville, NJ area may pick up their orders in person or request
        free home delivery. If you would like to use this option, please call to place your order.

    <p>
        <b>Timeframe</b><br />
        Most products are delivered within a week. However, because of the custom nature
        of our products, we cannot guarantee a specific shipping timeframe. We will make
        every effort to ensure that you receive your merchandise as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Shipping Damage/Insurance</b><br />
        Shipping damage is insured by the shipping agent. Claims due to shipping damage
        should be filed with the shipping agent.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Pricing</b><br />
        Because our items are so different from one another, the shipping cost varies from
        item to item. Clicking an item's Buy Now button will provide you with an instant
        shipping quote.</p>
